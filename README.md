# HollowCore
A cross-platform and cross-language object system written in C11.

HollowCore is comprised of a core module of the same name as well as modules for compatibility with other programming languares, user interfacing, ray tracing and other modules. 

The core module defines a reference-counted memory model and object system for creating polymorphic opaque-types in pure C11 source code. It includes basic data types for booleans, integers, and real numbers defined in a language-agnostic way, with operations for approximate equality, hashing, and printing to data streams. The object system defines a base object (*HCObject*) and object subtypes for strings (*HCString*), numbers (*HCNumber*), and byte arrays (*HCData*). These objects wrap basic C types of the same usage and provide additional facilities for working with them. They also enable inclusion of these data in containers, with the core module providing an ordered-nonexclusive container (*HCList*), unordered-exclusive container (*HCSet*) and a key-value container (*HCMap*). These types can be serialized and deserialized in JSON format using (*HCJSON*). All these objects can be used in a multi-thread safe way by utilizing threads (*HCThread*), locking (*HCLock*), and conditions (*HCCondition*).

The core module also defines types for geometry and two dimensional graphics. It provides basic geometry for points (*HCPoint*), rectangles and sizes (*HCSize* and *HCRectangle*), curves and contours (*HCContour*), and paths (*HCPath*). These geometric primitives can be drawn to in-memory pixel rasters and serialized to streams using (*HCRaster*).

All of these objects are tested using unit and integration test cases using *ctest*. They are also verified for correct use of memory with a variety of tools including *valgrind* and *Instruments*. The status of continuous testing using *Travis* for the release version of the library may be monitored here:
